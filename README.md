# RayTracer
`Author: Ryan Godfrey`
 
## Usage

Installing and running the `main.py` code will produce 4 random lines (walls). Your mouse will be tracked and rays will be cast in all directions, simulating light. Rays that intersect with the walls will produce a "shadow", similar to what actual light would produce.
